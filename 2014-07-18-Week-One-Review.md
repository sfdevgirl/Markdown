#<u>Week One Review</u>
## [Hacker: Coding Academy](http://hackercodingacademy.com)


So naturally it starts misting on my way to school- I didn’t bring a jacket. Then my transfer bus was late so I ended up being 15 minutes late to class: but better late then never. I walk in and there’s about 10 people there sitting in a circle, making it hard to tell who’s a teacher and who’s a student. As we start introductions I meet 

	


* J - *Director*
* A - *Administration*
* H - *Teacher#1 (later I will meet B, teacher#2)*
* G - *Part-time Student*
* Ja - *Student*
* Je - *Student*
* M - *Student*
* Jn - *Student*

However, by the end of the week the class consists of Ja, Je, Jn, and myself. 

*I have not asked permission to use people’s names, so I will be using initials until they say otherwise*

##My Opinion

####Class Size
<b>Pros</b>: it's small<br>
<b>Cons</b>: it's small
<br>Here's why: Like I mentioned earlier, I don't do well with large groups. So having it be a group of only 4 + teacher is actually perfect for me. My anxiety is non existent, I can focus so much more. But yes, there are always pros of having a large group: more people to bounce ideas off of, questions you didn't think of being asked and answered, etc etc. But overall I am very pleased with it. And we all get along and respect each other; I think that's the best part.

#### Teachers
H and B are amazing teachers. They really know their stuff. I'm really looking forward to everything I'm going to learn from them. If they've never taught before, I would never know. They explain concepts well and if they don't know something, they say so! Not everyone knows everything; I'd rather them say that then me memorize false information. The only feedback I have for them would be for us to have more "lectures". I feel like I'm behind, and not because I'm not doing the work, but because I don't fully understand it. I think I would understand more if I saw it being done on the screen along with a step by step explanation.

## But hey, I survived week one of bootcamp!

#### It's already the end of week two and I'm just getting this out, that's how much work I have! I should have my week two review out by Sunday; stay tuned!
