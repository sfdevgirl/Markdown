# Tomorrow Bootcamp Begins

...And I'm so nervous! I'm not really a "people person" and spend most of my time by myself or with my roommate (and when I say most of the time, I mean 99.9% of the time). I even transfered to a self study high school after my sophomore year because  of that reason. I just get too much anxiety. I always get embarrassed when I speak because I think I'm going to get the answer wrong, or say something stupid. Even though I have no reason to think that way; I've always been in the top percent of my classes. I don't know, I've just always been that way. Especially with my writing. I started writing poems and short stories in 6th grade (about the time I stopped wanting to be an astronaut), and fell in love with it. Expressing your deepest feelings on paper in a way you never would be able to out loud. I started an anonymous blog a few years ago to be able to share my feelings without anyone knowing I wrote it. I guess it helped because I can not even believe I'm starting a public blog; this is so out of my element. Then again, so is being around people, and I'm about to be around my coding "crew" 40+ hours a week! I think I'm just ready for a change and a new chapter in my life and all this is just the beginning of that.
