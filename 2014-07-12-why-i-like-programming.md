# Why I Like Programming
<p>I always hated math, but not because I didn't like it, but because I always got the answer wrong. I'll explain: I can't do simple math. I just never learned. Sounds silly, but it's true. I'm good at equations though. Those I could remember; and would get right. If you look at my old high school algebra 2 tests, I would set up the equation right from start to finish; but why is it wrong? Because somewhere along solving it I put <i>7 x 3 = 24.</i>

What I've figured out so far since starting Java Script; it's pretty much setting up and solving equations; <b>only the computer does the basic math for you!Â </b>How awesome is that!

Guess I never needed to learn basic math anyways.</p>
