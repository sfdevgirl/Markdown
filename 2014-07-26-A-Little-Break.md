# A Little Break From...
## ...Hacker:Coding Academy


So I haven't written in a while (shows you how much work I have), but it turns out class is starting over anyways. Two people dropped out last week, leaving only two left. More students start Aug. 4th, so they decided we would just start over then. The curriculum, while good, was unorganized, and switching teachers every other day just made that worse. So they're taking the next week to get everything together, planned, and organized better. And I'm actually glad. I feel like we skipped over the basics, which are the blocks which we build everything on. If we don't know the basics how are we going to understand the hard stuff? I felt really behind even though I was doing the work. So now I can take this next week to get ahead. 

### My Week Off Plan
+ Codecademy's JavaScript Track
+  Finish Khan Academy's CS Course
+ My Blog
	- I'm trying to change the platform of my blog (which is why I haven't been writing) to a node.js static generator, however, npm won't work on OS X Yosemite, so I'm kinda screwed with that one until that gets fixed. I was thinking of using Jekyll, but think I'll get confused learning Ruby while learning JS. I've been looking at (which are all coffeescript,I believe. If anyone has advice on which to use, let me know) 
		* Docpad
		* Wintersmith
		* Assemble 
 
+ Freelance
	- One of my teachers thinks I know enough to start freelance work. I disagree, but I guess that's why he's the teacher, and I'm the student. I created a profile on Odesk.com but I think I'm going to hold off on bringing that into focus until I feel more comfortable with JS (or jQuery or CoffeeScript)
	
### In The Meantime

I'll try to write some more posts, if not Week One (again) starts August 4th!
